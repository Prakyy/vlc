# Native Dark Mode for VLC 3.0

**Story:**

I always wanted a native dark mode for VLC and was surprised that despite being open-source, no one has created one, specially for windows.

I tried the VLC 4.0 native build, but the UI was completely reworked and it has bugs due to which it is unusable.

I decided to search the internet for unofficial versions but there were none.

So I created a native dark version on my own.  
Cheers!


## How to use:

* Just download the zip or installer.
* Launch VLC
* Go to preferences and select dark mode.
* Save and Restart VLC.
* Enjoy!!!!
